## About Me 👋
Hey there! I'm a highly disciplined and ambitious person who thrives on challenges and continuous learning. Responsibility, adaptability, and loyalty are values I hold close, and they’ve helped me achieve excellence both academically and in sports where I’m proud to be a 5-time National Champion in rowing 🚣‍♂️🏆.
